<h1>Development of a Web Tool for Anonymous Feedback Collection</h1>

<p><strong>Authors:</strong> Panaite Alexandra-Mihaela, Ghen»õa Ana-Maria </p>

<h2 id="introduction">1 Introduction </h2>
<p>FeedbackHub is a web platform that specializes in collecting anonymous feedback for various entities, including events, people, geographic locations, products, services and artistic artifacts. Users can express feedback in the form of emotions, according to the Plutchik model. The platform is accessible through a REST/GraphQL API, allowing management of evaluated entities and the specific responses received for each entity. Feedback collection requests can be edited by originators, and statistics are generated after the collection period, providing insights based on recorded emotions and criteria such as user demographics, time periods, subcategories and positive/negative characteristics.
</p>
<h3 id="product-scope">1.4 Product Scope</h3>

<p>FeedbackHub facilitates the collection of anonymous feedback for various entities. Users can send feedback by expressing emotions according to the Plutchik model. The platform allows the management of feedback requests, the generation of statistical reports and the provision of information based on the collected data.

<h3 id="product-functions">2.2 Product Functions</h3>

<p>FeE includes the following main functionalities:

</p>

<ol>
    <li>    Management of Feedback Requests: Users can create, edit and manage feedback requests, specifying the evaluated entity, the length of the collection period and the allowed emotions.
</li>
    <li>    Analysis of Collected Feedback: The platform analyzes the collected feedback to generate statistical reports for each form. These reports provide information based on recorded emotions.
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="user-classes-and-characteristics">2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>

<p>
FeedbackHub is intended for the following classes of users:

</p>

<ol>
    <li>        Initiators: Users who initiate and manage feedback requests. They must be logged in to be able to create a feedback form.

</li>
    <li>   Respondents: Users who provide anonymous feedback for various entities. They interact with the platform to send their emotions.

</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="environment">2.4 Operating Environment</h3>

<p>
FeedbackHub operates in an environment specified as follows:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>           Hardware Platform: The application runs on a dedicated or virtualized web server with adequate processing and storage capacity to handle the volume of data and user traffic.
</li>
    <li>      Operating Systems: Developed to run on Linux, Windows and macOS operating systems (if required).
</li>
</ol>
        <p>
             Software Components:
        </p>
        <ol> 
         <li>                  Web Server: Uses a web server (Apache HTTP Server) to handle HTTP requests and communicate with the database and other components.
</li>
    <li>             Database: Uses a MySQL database management system (DBMS) to store and manage the collected data.
</li>
 <li>           REST API: Exposes a REST API to facilitate client-server communication.
</li>
    <li>      Data Format: Generated reports are available in HTML, CSV and JSON formats, thus ensuring compatibility and accessibility for different user needs.
</li>
        </ol>
